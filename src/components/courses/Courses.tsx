          <b>CS 188: Software Engineering</b>
          <br />- This course provides an in-depth study of the design and
          development of software. The life cycle of software, various
          development strategies, requirements analysis, design tools, and
          testing methodologies will be covered. These concepts will be explored
          in theory as well as in practice; students will gain experience in
          conceiving, specifying, designing, developing and implementing a
          reasonably sized software solution alongside a team of students from
          computer science.
        </p>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          <b>CS 178: Cloud Computing and DB Systems (AWS)</b>
          <br />- This course will focus on how large amounts of data are
          stored, accessed, and ultimately analyzed. Cloud concepts,
          capabilities, and computing models will be explored and will include
          hands-on experiences with tools for working with large-scale
          distributed file systems (e.g., Hadoop). Students will also develop
          skills working with relational databases (e.g., SQL) and unstructured
          databases (e.g., no SQL). This course is designed to complement rather
          than overlap the existing course Database Management
        </p>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          <b>CS 167: Machine Learning</b>
          <br />- Introduction to foundational and contemporary machine learning

          topics will vary but may include artificial neural networks, decision
          trees, instance-based learning, Bayesian learning, support vector
          machines, hidden Markov models, text categorization, and k-means
          clustering. Modern machine learning software and programming libraries
          will be utilized.
        </p>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          <b>CS 161: Compiler Construction</b>
          <br />- This course provides an understanding of the various phases of
          the programming language translation process. Compiler principles and
          tools are examined, and applied to the development and implementation
          of a working language processor. Various parsing techniques are
          compared.
        </p>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          <b>CS 160: Operating Systems</b>
          <br />- Introduction to the design, development and implementation of
          operating systems. Problems of resource allocation, concurrency, file
          system design, networking and the interface between hardware and
          software. Examination of actual operating system source code.
        </p>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          <b>CS 143: Artificial Intelligence</b>
          <br />- Introduction to the theory, tools and methods of artificial
          intelligence. Topics include knowledge representation, predicate
          calculus, basic data structures, and problem solving strategies. A
          symbol manipulation language is used. Computer science aspects of
          artificial intelligence are emphasized. Applications from areas such
          as natural language understanding, vision or expert systems are
          examined.
        </p>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          <b>CS 137: Algorithm Analysis</b>
          <br />- Formal and informal methods for analyzing the correctness and
          efficiency of algorithms. Implementation and analysis of advanced
          algorithms and data structures such as AVL trees, B-trees,
          hash-tables, heaps, and graph algorithms. Introduction to complexity
          theory and NP-Completeness.
        </p>
        <p className="text-secondary">
          <b>CS 135: Programming Languages (Haskell)</b>
          <br />- Principles of programming languages are studied from the
          perspectives of design and implementation. Syntactic and semantic
          features are examined in a variety of languages. Run-time structures
          for handling both data and control structures are introduced. The
          course concentrates on imperative and object-oriented paradigms, but
          also covers functional and logic languages.
